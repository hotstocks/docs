### AI Algorithms in Trading

- Natural Language Processing
- **Text Processing**: Learn to prepare text obtained from different sources for further processing, by cleaning, normalizing and splitting it into individual words or tokens.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transform text using methods like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, word2Vec and GloVE to extract features that you can use in machine learning models.
- **Financial Statements**:Learn how to scrape data from financial documents using ```Regular Expression``` and ```BeautifulSoup```.
- **Basic NLP Analysis**; Learn how to apply NLP to financial statements.
- **Generate Alpha factor from company filing**: NLP analysis on 10-K filing statements to generate an alpha factor.
- **Neural Networks**: Learn several techbiques to train neural network.
- **Deep Learning**: Learn how to use PyTorch for building deep learning models
- **Recurrent Neural Networks**: Learn how to use neural networks to learn from sequential data such as text. Build a network that can generate realistic text one letter a time.
- **Embedding and Word2Vec**: Lerb about embedding in neural networks by implementing the Word2Vec model.
- **Sentiment Prediction RNN**: Implement the sentiment prediction RNN for predicting whether a movie review is positive or negative.
- **Decision Tree**: Implement the decision tree structure to make the decision.
- **Random Forest**: Learn about random forest models and how to use them to combine alpha factors.
- **Feature Engineering**: Learn to engineer features such as market dispersion, market volatility, sector and date parts.
- **Overlaping Labels**: Learn about the issue with non-indpendent labels that comes up during alpha combination with machine learning model.
- **Feature Importance**: Implement feature importance to decide how relevant each feature is to a machine learning model's predition.
- **Enhanced Alpha Research**: Implement random forest model to enhance better alpha. 
- **Backtesting**: Use backtesting to determine whether or not your strategies can be generalizable to future unseen data.
- **Optimization with transection costs**: optimize the portfolio return in a backtest more realistic and more computationally efficient way.
- **Attribution** : Use performance attribution to determine how each factor contribute to the protfolio's return.
